                    How can a website help your buissness
                  </h1>
                  <div>
                    <p>
                      Thinking of getting a website for your buissness? Maybe your
                      not sure how it can help you grow your buissness and revenue 
                      let us show you. A website is like adding a buissness within your buissness.
                      That might sound confusing but think of it like this you have your in-person 
                      buissness and your virtual buissness. People can find and order from buissness
                      online and in-peron.

                    </p>
                      A website is like taking or scaling your buissnes to that next level.
                      Because not only can people find your buissnes in-person but they can find
                      it online. You see in todays society social media and the internet is a big thing,
                      more than 60% of the world is on the web. Thats 60% of the world misssing without
                      access to your buissnes to order or contact you. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Websites not only drive traffic to those who find it on the web, but also
                      those who found it friends. That probally did not make sense but have you
                      ever sent an intresting article or funny video to someone? The answer is probally 
                      yes. That is the same with your buissnes if someone finds your buissnes good and 
                      are satified with their results from your buissness/service they will send it to
                      other whom could use or would find it intresting.
